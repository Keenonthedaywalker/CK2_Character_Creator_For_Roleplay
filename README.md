# CK2_Character_Creator_For_Roleplay
If you want to play ck2 but you have no idea who to play as, then use this to generate a random character then create the generated character in game, either using the character creator dlc or console commands. Enjoy.

Things I still need to do:
~ Add an ambition generator(More like goal generator)
~ Make it so that the generated character will also generate a txt document when generated
~ ???
